Peeps must be transparent PNGs in 1024x1024 resolution.  
Those textures must be added to [src/static/peeps](src/static/peeps).

Positioning of a texture is done by adding the texture filename
without .png as a key to [the peeps JavaScript file](src/peeps.js).

Any matching pair will be shown at the given point.
